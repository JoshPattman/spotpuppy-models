This is a 3D printable quadruped robot designed for use with a raspberry pi 4. The actuators are MG90D micro servos and the whole robot bolts together with M3 bolts. Take at look at [this](http://github.com/JoshPattman/spotpuppy-go) golang module which is being created together with this robot to make it walk.
